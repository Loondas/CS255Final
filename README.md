DriverPass wanted to create a system to extend their userbase to an online platform. They wished to
enable customers to study and manage their learning and payment online, with minimal administrative
intervention.

I believe my scope and flow is well-conceived. When accounting for details, I believe I was complete
in my assessments. Additionally, grouping multiple tasks as sub-tasks for a greater goal adds clarity
and a relational assessment which enhances the design.

If i were to revise my document, I would focus on my UML activity diagram. There is further detail
to add, such as separation of administrative entities, and their role in the system. Further,
accounting for errors and driver availability could have been further explored.

In order to interpret the user's needs, I examined other websites with similar services offered.
By using this for a baseline, and refining the design to incorporate specific stated requirements,
I could include all the elements which a user is likely to be comfortable with while simultaneously
personalizing it for the product owner's purpose. If the user feels like the product is alien,
DriverPass would likely be passed up by a nearby competitor with a more attractive design. If 
DriverPass does not feel like the design is personalized for their model, they are likely to 
develop a negative opinion on my services. Either way, the reputation and career of both companies
is on the line.

My approach to designing software consists mainly on an object-oriented approach. By separating a
project into manageable chunks, I can easily inherit and modify any code without compromising the
coding structure. This also makes data management simple, as listing like objects and iterating
through them and their associated data is able to be accomplished with a few lines of code.

My general strategy in the future will be to generalize before I specify. In other words, build a
system that meets the basic requirements, then work on it to incorporate full requirement
integration. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Functionality is king, so taking a system
which has been proven and adding novel elements to the design is an efficient method that I 
intend to take full advantage of.
